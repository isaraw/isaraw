      <h3>Old Age Kicks</h3>

        <p> Hanging   on the walls of Alessandro Negrini&rsquo;s living room in Derry there are   posters of Casablanca, Charlie Chaplin, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Alda   Merini smoking a cigarette and Italian directors as Rossellini, De Sica   and Fellini. &ldquo;Everything started for fun. As I always say, I'm a movie   director by mistake, in the sense that I wanted to do something else in   my life, like being an hairdresser,&rdquo; he said. Paradiso, his last   documentary, shot in Derry, will be screened today at the Arcipelago   Rome Film Festival.<br /><br />Alessandro  recalls that his  grandfather used to run a cinema in a small town in  Italy, which turned  into a ball room every Saturday night. &ldquo;Perhaps it  was in my genes that  sooner or later I would have become a  director...or a ticket collector.  But I realized that being a director  paid more,&rdquo; he jokes.<br /><br />He   claims to be inspired by a friend of his, the Norwegian director Knut   Eric Yensen, and by the movies of Federico Fellini: &ldquo;I worship him   though it would be even outrageous to say that he's my reference point.&rdquo;   However, his mother has been his true guiding star.&nbsp; When he was a   child, she used to bring him to the ball rooms: &ldquo;Paradiso is also a   tribute to a world that is vanishing, the world of the ball rooms, where   I grew up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My mother thought me to never get old, which   doesn't mean not having wrinkles, but not being disenchanted.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;When   I grew up I was convinced that I wanted to be a poet.&rdquo; He also went to   live in Paris to write poems for two years. Then he read a quote by   Benedetto Croce: &ldquo;Until the age of 18 everybody writes poems. From 18   years on two categories remain: the poets and the idiots&rdquo;. &ldquo;I've always   been afraid to belong to the second one, so I stopped,&rdquo; he jokes. &ldquo;But I   still write them for myself. Instead of going to the shrink, a  notebook  costs 99p, the analyst costs 99&pound;, you know... &ldquo;<br /><br />After   having produced a couple of short movies in Italy, in 2001 he moved to   Derry where he shot &ldquo;The House of Phrases&rdquo;, with a budget of only  &pound;500:  &ldquo;We used a chair with wheels instead of the track.&rdquo; The film won  the&nbsp;  Best Online International Documentary award at the 14th Foyle Film   festival in Derry, the Underground Film&nbsp; Festival in Dublin and the   Havana Film Festival in Cuba.<br /><br />His  second short movie shot  in Ireland, Lies and Waves, tells the story of  the friendship between an  old man who's never seen the sea - as his  grandfather, he says - and a  child who has always told lies. &ldquo;I've  always been fascinated by people  who live off-hour, who follow their  inner clock,&rdquo; he says.<br /><br />Between   2006 and 2009 Alessandro worked on Paradiso. The movie tells the story   of&nbsp; a musician, Roy Arbucke, who decides to reunite his former  Showband,  The Signetts, and his formers musicians, now in their  seventies,  organizing a major dance night where Protestants and  Catholics could  finally dance<br /><br />together again in The Fountain, a Protestant ghetto in Derry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;Roy   is a poet, a person able to interpret that reality raising its level  of  interpretation,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;However, I found out that is much easier  to  bring together Catholics and Protestants than the musicians:  generally  they are all primadonna&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br /><br />The  movie was then selected  for the Monterrey International Film Festival  in Mexico and won the Slow  Film Festival in Hungary. &ldquo;This gave me  confidence. I thought that the  film had an international appeal, not  that it could win.&rdquo; Afterwards,  the movie won the <strong style="">Best Documentary Award</strong> in Bangladesh;<strong style=""> the Audience Award</strong>&nbsp; in Germany; the <strong style="">Best Documentary Award</strong> in India and was selected in many other international festivals.<br /><br />At   the beginning the problem was to convince someone to finance it.   &ldquo;Nobody gave a damn of this ghetto full of old Protestants,&rdquo; says   Alessandro. &ldquo;When I discovered it at the time, they even used to close   the gate with a chain.&rdquo; However, &ldquo;I was so lucky to have probably one of   the best producers around, Margo Harkin, of Besom Productions, which   produced Waive Raiders, to name one,&rdquo; says Alessandro. The movie was   eventually financed by the BBC.&nbsp; The director of photography, Odd Geir   Saeter, worked in Inland Empire, David Lynch's last movie.<br /><br />The   gamble of the movie was that neither Alessandro nor Margo knew the   outcome of the ball night. Until the eve of the ball there were 40   tickets sold out of 300 and it looked like the night was going to be a   flop. &ldquo;If it was so I would have shot the disappointment of a dream that   never came true. On the contrary there were 300 people,&rdquo; he commented.<br /><br />A   movie about Derry means a movie about the troubles, by definition. But   Alessandro didn't want a movie about the troubles: &ldquo;I was fed up with   them as many other people are. The troubles are there but it's not a   movie about the troubles. They are the expedient to talk about&nbsp; a   culture where people live in fear of each other and with the need of an   enemy. The enemy gives them an identity.&rdquo;<br /><br />Alessandro  has  an insight of the city which gave the movie a sort of universal  and  critical touch, as he observes: &ldquo;The movie is not much about Derry  but  rather about a reality that could be translated in Mexico as in any   other place in the world. I think that Derry owns the appeal of places   that have just abandoned&nbsp; a conflict, but it is spoiling this energy.  It  could really revive, instead it is simply recreating the old. It's  like  if it was in love with its own chains.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>
