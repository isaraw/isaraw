      <h3>From Door to Door to Online Acquisitions</h3>
      
      <div class="blog-item-single-content"> 
        
        <h5>About</h5>
         <p>The client is one of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">global leading development and humanitarian relief organisations</span>, dedicated to addressing the causes of poverty worldwide. 
They work in a number of areas including transformational development, emergency relief, promotion of justice, strategic initiatives and promotion of public awareness. 
Their Irish office main fundraising activities are child sponsorship programmes and charitable donations, alongside charity gifts, and fundraising and advocacy events, among others.</p>


   
 <h5>The Challenge</h5>
          
         <p> 
            For many years, the NGO's main fundraising strategy has been door-to-door fundraising. Faced with increasing competition in the crowded Irish market and with online donations constantly growing over the past decade, the client tasked our team with the challenge of developing a comprehensive online strategy, inclusive of <span style="font-weight: bold;">website development an ongoing digital marketing</span> promotion, with the final objectives of digitally acquire child sponsors and donors on an ongoing bases. </p>
<p>The client also needed to increase brand awareness in Ireland. The challenge was for our team to create a digital design and strategy that would increase public awareness of relevant target groups and at the same time stand out from competitors, cutting through the noise of increasingly pervasive online advertising techniques.

   </p>
          
           <h5>The Strategy</h5>
        
<p>Sponsorship is a long-term commitment of a sponsor to support a child and their communities through their developmental journey. Choosing an organization to sponsor a child entails research, consideration and trust building. For this reason, we decided to run a permeating and comprehensive digital campaign that would <span style="font-weight: bold;">establish the client as a global leader organization </span>in child sponsorship programmes and emergency response, and conveyed the imagine of a trusted non-profit brand in the controversial scenario of charities events that have eroded Irish people’s trust in recent years. </p>
<p>The website was redesigned to provide the best online experience from acquisition to retention, including increasing conversion rates, engagement, improved search engine ranking, usability, mobile experience, social media integration, and simplicity.  </p>

<p>The main objectives of the digital marketing strategy were to increase brand awareness and lead generation. The objectives were pursued through a comprehensive set of goals and KPIs distributed across a number of digital marketing channels and tools.
We profiled and targeted the audience though sophisticated targeting options available in most digital channels, including demographic characteristics, locations, behaviours and interests online.</p>
<p>Digital marketing activities included:

              •	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Media Organic and Paid marketing</span>: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Google +, YouTube;
